Long Island Drupal Group Meetup (https://groups.drupal.org/node/336033)
2013-10-16

TOPIC:
UX UI MMXIII
Designing || Theming 
Prototype ... Production

This folder contains:

UX_UI_MMXIII.PDF ... slide deck 
moiLivres.xmind ... Xmind file for case study (Get the free mind mapping tool: http://www.xmind.net/)

All assests for live prototypes:

codiqa-20131015.ZIP (full version)
proto-io_moiLivres_20131016.ZIP (starting point - not all features implemented)

and codiqa's export files for PhoneGap ... android/iOS and android debug
http://phonegap.com/

I think PhoneGap is going to play an integral part in connecting a prototype and drupal CMS to make really cool mobile apps!

The challenge is to connect the prototype code to access the drupal cms database and vice versa collecting user input from the mobile device and displaying it in the drupal views etc.
